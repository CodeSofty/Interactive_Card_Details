## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project's layout was a bit of a challenge, and I had to rethink what I was wanting to do.
Initially I thought about flexboxing everything, but decided against that and decided the easiest solution would be CSS Grid as the primary layout and Flexbox to help where it could best be used.

Regex was a bit of a challenge until I found a really helpful  [Regex Generator](https://regex-generator.olafneumann.org/?sampleText=2020-03-12T13%3A34%3A56.123Z%20INFO%20%20%5Borg.example.Class%5D%3A%20This%20is%20a%20%23simple%20%23logline%20containing%20a%20%27value%27.&flags=i&onlyPatterns=false&matchWholeLine=false&selection=)


### Continued development

I'd like to focus more on layout and positioning. Firefox displays this project just fine, but Chrome struggles with the positioning.
